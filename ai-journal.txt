Week 1
This week, I didn't really use AI during my practice problems. I only used ChatGPT to
explain a few terms for me, but other than that, I didn't use it. It wasn't used to 
complete any problems or debugging.

Week 2
This week, I didn't use any AI during my problems. However, for our discussion on canvas, I ended up trying a new AI named Perplexity, and was let down on it. However, it was never used on an assignment, so I didn't document it at all.
